### Goals

The goal of this tool is to offer a simple interface for downloading, storing, and getting access to neuroimaging datasets.  We want to:
* Decrease the amount of time spent by data scientists in accessing new datasets
* Decrease the difficulty of scientists in sharing their data with the world
* Increase the visibility of available data


### Data types

The types of data we wish to expose include:
* MRI / fMRI / rsMRI / dMRI
* EEG / ERP / MEG / ECoG


### Dependencies

Because of the breadth of this package, dependencies could be far-ranging, increasing installation difficulty.  In order to ease installation, this repository includes many minimal installs of other code-bases.  Licenses for these codes are respective of each included package.  

These packages include:
* [nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/) - Machine learning for neuroimaging, contains generic download tools and logic for accessing fMRI datasets
* [pymvpa](https://github.com/PyMVPA/PyMVPA) - 
* [nibabel](https://github.com/nibabel/nibabel/) - Tools for accessing many formats of MRI data
